The above dashboard, found within the CitiBike story, consists of visualizations created during the module. From these visualizations, it can be seen that men consisted of over 65% of the individuals using the bikes. In addition, the bikes were used in greater quantity between 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM, with a slight increase at 8:00 AM.

When analyzing the bike usage by days of the week and gender, it can be seen that majority of the bikes were used during rush hours, assumingly for the customer to travel to and from work or school, and predominantly by men.

In this visualization, it can further be proven that most usage of the bikesharing service is from subscribers who would likely be using it as a means of transport to and from work. There is a relatively even distribution of CitiBike usage amongst the customers, across all genders.

Although men are seen to be using the CitiBikes more often, the duration of their usage is a merely 5 minutes, as seen in the visualization above. Through this visualization, it can be seen across all genders that use of the bikes is popular for a distance covered within 25 mintues.

# Summary

By analyzing the above visualizations from the CitiBike data, it can be seen that use of the bikesharing services is popular amongst many individuals. However, it is imperitive to note that usage of the service is concentrated to 'rush hour' times; where one would assume high traffic. In order to make an informed decision on whether the CitiBike bikesharing service is appropriate for De Moine, Iowa, it would be beneficial to determine whether the city experiences similar traffic trends as New York. Additional analyses involving the data can pertain to determining the effect of temperature and weather on the usage of the bikesharing service.
